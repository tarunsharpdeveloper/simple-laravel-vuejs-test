The e-toll fees may take 4-8 weeks after the rental to be billed to your credit card/debit card on file.  E-TOLL SERVICE CONVENIENCE FEES  The convenience fee for e-Toll usage is $3.95 up to $5.95 USD for each day you use the E-Toll device and there is a maximum of $19.75 up to $29.75 USD per rental month, plus toll charges.

E-toll unlimited must be purchased at the beginning of the rental.  OPTING OUT OF E-TOLL   If you do not choose e-toll unlimited at the time of rental, you may avoid the standard e-toll fees on any given day during the term of the rental if you ensure the transponder shield box is in the \"closed\" position and you pay cash for all tolls, use your own adequately funded, properly mounted and compatible electronic toll device to pay for all tolls, or pay the toll authority directly and follow the toll authority rules and requirements.

Place keys & completed contract in the drop box located on the rental counter.<br/><b>Towing</b> : Towing is not permitted. Vehicles cannot be used to tow or push anything.  A trailer hitch cannot be installed on the vehicles.<br/><b>Fuel Policy</b> : Fuel Service Charge. Most rentals come with a full tank of fuel, but that is not always the case.  Where available, if permitted by law, if you drive less than 75 miles, you acknowledge that we will add a flat fee to the rental, the amount of which will be disclosed on the Rental Contract and at the counter prior to rental. You may avoid this charge at time of return by providing a receipt for fuel purchased at which time the flat fee will be reversed from your total rental charges. If this subparagraph (a) does not apply, there are three refueling option  1) If you do not accept the fuel service option, where available, at the beginning of your rental, and you return the car with less fuel than was in it when you received it, as we determine in our sole discretion, we will charge you a fuel service charge at the applicable rate per-mile or rate per-gallon specified on the Rental Contract or disclosed at the location. The per-mile rate is used if you do not buy fuel during the rental. To calculate this amount, we multiply the number of miles driven, as shown on the car?s odometer (or provided by the vehicle's telematics device), times the per-mile rate shown on the Rental Contract. The per gallon rate is used if you buy fuel during the rental and provide us with a receipt on our request, but the tank is not as full when you return the car as when you received the car (by using the factory installed gauge, rounded down to the nearest 1/8 tank), times the per-gallon rate shown on the Rental Contract.  Although two methods are used for ease of calculation, the per mile and per-gallon rates produce approximately the same result. Some of our cars are equipped with onboard telematics which record the actual amounts of fuel in the gas tank. In the event your car has such a device, you will be charged for the actual amount of gasoline needed to fill the tank based on the reading of this device.  2) If you accept the fuel service option at the beginning of your rental, you will be charged as shown on the Rental Contract for that purchase and you will not pay us a fuel service charge. If you choose this option, you will not incur an additional fuel service charge, but you will not receive any credit for fuel left in the tank at the time of return.  If you accept the partial fuel service option at the beginning of your rental, you will be charged as shown on the Rental Contract for that purchase and you will pay a fuel service charge for any fuel not covered by the partial fuel service option. The per-gallon cost of the fuel service option will always be lower than the fuel service charge. The cost of refueling the car yourself at a local service station may be lower than the fuel service charge or the fuel service option. You acknowledge that the fuel service charge is not a retail sale of fuel.  3) You may avoid a fuel service charge if you return the car with the fuel tank as full as when you received it and, if requested by us, present a receipt for your fuel purchase. If you put fuel into the car, you must use the correct fuel (having the grade of gasoline stated on the car fuel information decal, or on-road diesel). Do not use ethanol fuel even if the car states that it is a flex-fuel vehicle.<br/><b>Voucher</b> : Vouchers are not accepted.<br/><b>Travel Into Other States</b> : Vehicles at this location can be driven throughout the continental U.S. with no restrictions.  Based on availability, one-way rentals may be allowed to some U.S. cities.<br/><b>Additional Fees</b> : A frequent flyer surcharge of up to $1.00 per day applies to all rentals earning frequent flyer miles, points or credits.       Extensions or late returns may result in additional charges.<br/><b>Credit Card Policies</b> : Budget accepts most major credit cards as credit identification at the time of rental.

Accepted credit card list: Budget Charge Card, Budget International, American Express, Carte Blanche, Diner's Club, Diner's Club International, Discover, China UnionPay, JCB, MasterCard, Optima, Peterson, Howell and Heather (PHH) and Visa.  Some locations may not accept each of the referenced cards.     Budget may request an authorization hold against your account for the estimated rental charges of the rental, but reserves the right in its sole discretion to request an extra value to be based on certain factors as we deem appropriate:        Most rentals may require an authorization hold of the estimated rental charges plus $200.00 USD.       If you have prepaid the rental, the hold amount will be $250.00 USD.     While this hold is in place, the funds will not be available for your use.  When the rental is over, we will process the reversal, but the bank may take time to post it back to the account.     Note: Prepaid credit cards are not acceptable methods of credit identification to pick up a car at any location.  One of the above mentioned cards must be presented.  Prepaid credit cards are accepted at time of return only, if we can obtain full authorization from the card bank for the total charges due.<br/><b>Driver's License Requirements</b> : At time of rental, driver must present a valid drivers license in the drivers name. All drivers must have a safe driving record. In the U.S., you may be asked to sign a driving record addendum or be subject to a computerized Department of Motor vehicles check. Based upon such search, Budget reserves the right to deny a rental opportunity.  Renters who are renting (reservation, walkup or upsell) a specialty \"Street Fleet\" vehicle (all Group X vehicles) and presents a non-U.S. issued driver's license along with a U.S. address during the qualification process will also be required to produce a non U.S. issued passport from the same country identified on the driver's license that is presented. Renters presenting a driver's license from Mali or Cameroon who wish to rent a vehicle other than car groups A-E MUST also present an International Driver's Permit and a valid passport from the same country identified on the driver's license. These renters WILL also be required to present a secondary form of credit identification to complete the rental process.<br/><b>Public Liability and Property Damage</b> : Information not available at this time, please check at time of rental.        Public liability insurance is with in accordance of the insurance laws of the country.                  Customer may inquire for additional information of the benefits, conditions and acceptance at the time of rental.          Note: Some credit cards provide insurance coverage, with certain limitations, as a benefit of using the card to rent vehicles. The customer is advised to contact the card issuer before the rental. Any waiver must be discussed directly with the location upon arrival.    Information not available at this time, please check at time of rental.<br/><b>Additional Fees and Credit Holds</b> : In order to rent a car, we will put a hold on your credit card (or debit card at some locations) for the total estimated rental charges.  A prepaid card is not an acceptable method of credit identification for this hold.  While the hold is in place, the funds will not be available for your use.  Once you return the vehicle, we will process a release of the unused portion of the hold subject to your bank's procedures.  The hold could take up to 2 weeks to be released by your bank.  If you want to use a credit card for the hold, that amount will be the total estimated rental charges or $200.00, whichever is greater.  Upon paying your rental with a debit card, Budget will generally request an authorization hold against your account for the estimated charges of the rental but reserves the right in its sole discretion, to request extra value based on certain factors as we deem appropriate.  Some exceptions may apply.  If you have prepaid for the rental on Budget.com, the hold will be $250.00.  THESE FUNDS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR USE.  You will be subject to a credit check to determine creditworthiness and the rental may be denied based on the results of this check.  If you don't return the vehicle as agreed, we will obtain additional debit hold authorizations from your account to cover the rental charges.  We are not responsible for any returned checks or over-drafts due to our debit hold policy.  A debit, check card or prepaid card can be used for payment of rental charges upon car return.  Except for a surcharge for renters under 25 years of age at some locations, your total rental rate is calculated based on the information provided at time of reservation.  The rate is based on the exact parameters (location, dates, etc.) of your particular rental -- so changing any of your confirmed reservation parameters could result in a different rates, taxes and fees.  Quoted taxes and fees are subject to change which will affect your final total due at rental return.  Vehicles are rented on a daily (24-hour) basis with a 29-minute grace period for returns. After 30 minutes late, a 3/4-day late charge + $.01 + taxes apply.  After 90 minutes late, full-day late charges + taxes apply.  If you reserve any type of vehicle that requires a credit card hold and you no longer require the rental, you must cancel the reservation before the scheduled pick-up time or you will be charged a $75.00 fee ($50.00 for a budget.com paid rental).  The U.S. Government imposes a $5.00 per day Admin Rate Supplement (GARS) for U.S. Government rentals.    If you selected an Optional Product (coverages, GPS, child safety seat, Roadside SafetyNet, XM Radio, etc.) with your rental:   &gt;Prohibited use of your rental vehicle will void the Roadside SafetyNet Option.  &gt;The Fuel Service Option price is not included in your reservation total.  The prevailing market rate for fuel plus associated tax and fees will be charged when you return your car.  &gt;You are responsible for replacement costs if the Optional Product or its components are lost, stolen or damaged.  Products are charged on a daily (24-hour) basis.  There is no grace period for returns of Optional Products, so full-day late charges will apply.  If you used a coupon for your reservation:  &gt;Most savings are reflected in your quoted rate.  If your rental meets all coupon terms, any additional rate adjustment will be made when you pick up your car.  &gt;For an upgrade, your reserved car will be upgraded at time of rental subject to car availability.  This upgrade may not be used in conjunction with any other coupon, promotion or deal.  &gt;The value of your coupon has been deducted from the base rate (time and mileage) charges and is reflected in the approximate total.  Paper coupons, however, may not be applied online and should be presented at the counter.  Please refer to all coupons for the full terms.  Restrictions may apply.  Once you have picked up the car, if you wish to extend the rental return date past your originally scheduled time, you must call 800-824-6287.  A service fee of $10.00 will apply and your original per-day rental rate may change.  If you don't call to extend your rental within 7 hours of your originally scheduled return time, a late fee will apply.<br/><b>Required Credentials</b> : At time of pickup, all drivers must present a valid driver's license in their name (see \"Driver's License Requirements\" section for complete details).  - If the driver's license is not issued from the U.S., then the renter must also present a valid passport or Canadian enhanced license and a travel itinerary showing proof of return to the resident country.  - If the country of residence on the renter's credentials does not match the country indicated on the reservation, the rental rate will change.  - You may be asked to sign a driving record addendum or be subject to a computerized Department of Motor Vehicles check.  All drivers must have a safe driving record or Budget reserves the right to deny the rental.   At time of pickup, renter must present one of the following credential  - A valid credit card in the renter's name.  See the \"Credit Card Policies\" section for complete details.  - A valid debit card in the renter's name (at participating locations).  If using a debit card, additional documentation may be required.  See the \"Debit Card Policies\" section for complete details.  Note:  A prepaid, loadable charge card or gift card is not an acceptable credential.  When using some offer codes, you must provide association, corporate, or government credentials to prove eligibility for the special rate/benefit.  Keep your reservation confirmation number because it is necessary for modification, cancellation or refund requests.  Once your scheduled pick-up time passes, reservation changes cannot be made online.<br/><b>Travel Into Other Countries</b> : Canad  Vehicles may be driven into Canada with no restrictions.  The rental counter must be notified at the time of rental that you plan to drive into Canada so the location can provide a Canadian Non-Resident Insurance Card (provided at no cost).  Based on availability, one-way rentals may be allowed to some Canada cities.  Mexico:  Vehicles rented at this location are not allowed to travel into Mexico.<br/><b>Optional Coverages</b> : Acceptance of Loss Damage Waiver relieves the renter and authorized additional drivers of financial responsibility if the Budget car is damaged or stolen while under rental contract.  Using the vehicle in violation of any of the use restrictions listed on the rental agreement could void LDW and leave the renter fully responsible for any damage to the vehicle.  LDW is not available in all states and certain restrictions may apply in some states.  At the time of rental, the customer must initial whether he/she accepts or declines the LDW and/or other optional services.  LDW and other optional services must be signed for at the rental counter.  If LDW is not accepted, the customer may be responsible for up to the full fair market value of the car if it is damaged, vandalized or stolen during the rental.  The customer may also be responsible for reimbursing Budget for the revenue lost by not being able to use the car while it is being repaired or not recovered due to theft (referred to as Loss Of Use).<br/><b>Debit Card Policies</b> : This location does accept bank debit cards with the MasterCard or Visa logo at the time of rental for specific car groups with the following requirement        Renter must be at least 25 years of age.       The name of the renter must be on the debit card.       A debit card is accepted as credit identification for all car groups except for makes and models identified as specialty vehicles (car group X vehicles) and certain other premium vehicles like convertibles.       At airport locations, you will be required to show proof of a return airline flight that corresponds with your rental.       You will be subject to a credit check to determine and ensure credit worthiness before releasing the car to you.  If your credit file is frozen with Equifax, you will be required to lift the restriction prior to your rental.  Lifting the restriction does not guarantee that you will be able to rent a vehicle as you will still be subject to a credit check.     Budget will generally request an authorization hold against your account for the estimated rental charges of the rental, but reserves the right in its sole discretion to request an extra value to be based on certain factors as we deem appropriate:        Most rentals may require an authorization hold of the estimated rental charges plus $200 USD.       Rentals of 4 days or more may require an authorization hold of the estimated rental charges plus $300 USD.       If you have prepaid the rental with a debit card, the hold is $250.00 USD.     THESE FUNDS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR USE.  When the rental is over, we will process the reversal, but the bank may take time to post it back to the account.  If you fail to return the vehicle as agreed, Budget will obtain additional authorizations from your account to cover the rental charges.  Budget is not responsible for any returned checks or overdraft fees based on this policy.  Positive identification in addition to your driver's license may be required.     Note: Prepaid Debit/Gift cards are not acceptable methods of credit identification to pick up a car at any location.  Prepaid Debit/Gift cards are accepted at time of return only, if we can obtain full authorization from the card bank for the total charges due.<br/>",

We cannot guarantee the make or model of the rental vehicle will be the same as the vehicle displayed on our website.<br/><b>Voucher</b> : A printed version of your voucher must be produced upon arrival at the rental desk. Failure to present the voucher means the car rental agent may charge you at the local rates. Please note: We are not responsible for overcharges on rentals where the voucher was not presented to the local agent on collection of the vehicle. If you do not present the required documents, the documentation is not valid or you do not have enough funds on your credit card, the car rental agent may refuse to release the vehicle and no funds will be reimbursed.<br/><b>Cancellation and no-show policy</b> : What is your cancellation policy for fully prepaid or part-paid bookings? 1 - If you cancel 24 hours prior to your pick-up, you will be refunded in full. 2 - If you cancel less than 24 hours in advance of pick-up, you will receive a refund minus USD58. If your online payment is less than USD58, no refund will be made for your car hire booking. 3 - If your booking is made less than 24 hours before pick up, the cancellation policy will automatically apply to your booking. 4 - All cancellations should be made on our online portal and not with the car hire agent. Should you agree to cancel directly with the car hire agent on arrival, you must also inform us of this change to your booking. 5 - Amending your booking or cancelling optional extras may not be possible less than 24 hours before pick up. If you purchased our Damage Refund Insurance product and have since decided to cancel your car rental booking, the Damage Refund Insurance will be cancelled automatically. If you wish to amend or rearrange your booking, the Damage Refund Insurance will initially be cancelled. We will, however, automatically create a new policy for your new booking. In both cases you will receive an email to confirm the cancellation at the email address you have provided during the online booking process. Please be aware that if you cancel your insurance policy less than 24 hours before the start of your car hire agreement, no refund for insurance will be granted. What is a no-show? A 'no-show' occurs for the following reason 1 - You didn't inform us about your cancellation prior to your pick-up time. 2 - You failed to pick up the car at the arranged time and date. 3 - You failed to provide the documentation that's required to pick up the car. 4 - You failed to provide a credit card in the main driver's name with enough available funds on it. In the event of any of the above, no refunds will be made to you. The car hire company reserves the right to refuse a car if you fail to arrive on time with all necessary documentation and a credit card with enough available funds for the car's security deposit. In such a case, unless the car hire has been cancelled at least 24 hours in advance, you will not be entitled to a refund.<br/>",

If your online payment is less than USD58, no refund will be made for your car hire booking. 3 - If your booking is made less than 24 hours before pick up, the cancellation policy will automatically apply to your booking. 4 - All cancellations should be made on our online portal and not with the car hire agent. Should you agree to cancel directly with the car hire agent on arrival, you must also inform us of this change to your booking. 5 - Amending your booking or cancelling optional extras may not be possible less than 24 hours before pick up. If you purchased our Damage Refund Insurance product and have since decided to cancel your car rental booking, the Damage Refund Insurance will be cancelled automatically. If you wish to amend or rearrange your booking, the Damage Refund Insurance will initially be cancelled. We will, however, automatically create a new policy for your new booking. In both cases you will receive an email to confirm the cancellation at the email address you have provided during the online booking process. Please be aware that if you cancel your insurance policy less than 24 hours before the start of your car hire agreement, no refund for insurance will be granted. What is a no-show? A 'no-show' occurs for the following reason 1 - You didn't inform us about your cancellation prior to your pick-up time. 2 - You failed to pick up the car at the arranged time and date. 3 - You failed to provide the documentation that's required to pick up the car. 4 - You failed to provide a credit card in the main driver's name with enough available funds on it. In the event of any of the above, no refunds will be made to you. The car hire company reserves the right to refuse a car if you fail to arrive on time with all necessary documentation and a credit card with enough available funds for the car's security deposit. In such a case, unless the car hire has been cancelled at least 24 hours in advance, you will not be entitled to a refund.<br/>",
